# Arduino Components

This is basically a small library for some Arduino components, mostly for my personal use. I'm going to add more components as I need to.

As of now, this library contains the following components:

* Simple Analog Input (`AnalogInput.h`)
* Button (`Button.h`)
* DC Motor (`DCMotor.h`)
    * `Direction` enum values: `Forward` and `Reverse`
* LED (`Led.h`)
* RGB LED (`RGBLed.h`)
